# Predicting NBA Wins with Bayesian Machine Learning

__Problem Description__

Each year, 30 NBA teams compete over 82 separate games. Knowing how well a team will perform can
influence personnel decisions like trades, hirings, or firings, as well as the expected revenue of the team.
Consequently, both team managers and fans are highly invested in team wins. What’s more, the May
2018 Supreme Court ruling on the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) as
unconstitutional opened the door for increased legality in sports gambling and the involvement of
oddsmakers. Having the ability to predict team outcomes more accurately than oddsmakers would result
in a competitive advantage that could be used to turn a profit. Even small improvements in the ability to
predict a team’s performance could have major financial implications.
The goal of this project is to use Bayesian statistics to model all teams’ win percentages given their
pre-season win projections and their in-season results through a specific time period. We chose our
in-season results cutoff date to be December 5th, which corresponds to about 25% of the total season
already having been played. We will model a team’s performance both with point estimates of projected
wins and credible intervals that determine uncertainty. Both elements are crucial, as they provide an
estimate of results and a measure of how certain these results are.
